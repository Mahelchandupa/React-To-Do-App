A minimalist Todo application built with React. This app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed or incomplete. It features a clean and intuitive user interface, and the state management is handled using React Context, Reducer and local storage, ensuring persistence even after page reloads.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

### Features:
- Add new tasks with titles and completion status.
- Edit existing tasks to modify titles or update completion status.
- Delete tasks to keep your list organized.
- Filter tasks based on completion status (all, completed, incompleted).
- Local storage integration for data persistence across sessions.

### Technologies Used:
- React (Hooks, Context, Reducer)
- Framer Motion for smooth animations.
- React Icons for easy integration of icons.
- Local storage for persistent data storage.
